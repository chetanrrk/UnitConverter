Bundle-Description: Contains    com.google.common.util.concurrent.intern
 al.InternalFutureFailureAccess and    InternalFutures. Most users will 
 never need to use this artifact. Its    classes is conceptually a part 
 of Guava, but they're in this separate    artifact so that Android libr
 aries can use them without pulling in all of    Guava (just as they can
  use ListenableFuture by depending on the    listenablefuture artifact)
 .
